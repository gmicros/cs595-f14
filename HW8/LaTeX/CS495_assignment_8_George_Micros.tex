\noindent


The goal of this project is to use the basic recommendation principles
we have learned for user-collected data. You will modify the code
given to you which performs movie recommendations from the MovieLense
data sets.The MovieLense data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research
Project at the University of Minnesota during the seven-month period
from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998. It is available
for download from \url{http://www.grouplens.org/node/73}

There are three files which we will use:


\begin{itemize}

\item  u.data: 100,000 ratings by 943 users on 1,682 movies. Each
user has rated at least 20 movies. Users and items are numbered
consecutively from 1. The data is randomly ordered. This is a tab
separated list of 

user id | item id | rating | timestamp

The time stamps are unix seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC.

Example:

196	242	3	881250949

186	302	3 	891717742

22	377	1 	878887116

244	51	2 	880606923

166	346	1 	886397596

298	474	4 	884182806

115	265	2	881171488

\item  u.item: Information about the 1,682 movies. This is a tab separated list of

movie id | movie title | release date | video release date | IMDb URL | unknown | Action | Adventure | Animation |Children's | Comedy | Crime | Documentary | Drama | Fantasy | Film-Noir | Horror | Musical | Mystery | Romance | Sci-Fi | Thriller | War | Western |

The last 19 fields are the genres, a 1 indicates the movie is of that genre, a 0 indicates it is not; movies can be in several genres at once. The movie ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

Example:

161|Top Gun (1986)|01-Jan-1986||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Top%20Gun%20(1986)|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0 
162|On Golden Pond (1981)|01-Jan-1981||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?On%20Golden%20Pond%20(1981)|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0 
163|Return of the Pink Panther, The (1974)|01-Jan-1974||http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?Return%20of%20the%20Pink%20Panther,%20The%20(1974)|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| 0|0|0|0|0

\item   u.user: Demographic information about the users. This is a tab
separated list of:

user id | age | gender | occupation | zip code

The user ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.

Example:

1|24|M|technician|85711 
2|53|F|other|94043 
3|23|M|writer|32067 
4|24|M|technician|43537 
5|33|F|other|15213

\end{itemize}

The code for reading from the u.data and u.item files and creating
recommendations is described in the book Programming Collective
Intelligence (check email for more details). You are to modify
recommendations.py to answer the following questions. Each question your
program answers correctly will award you 1 point.
