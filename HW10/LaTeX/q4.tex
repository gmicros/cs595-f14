\section{Question 4}

\subsection{The Question}

\begin{flushleft}

Redo questions 2 \& 3, but with manually train 90 entries and 
then classify the remaining 10.

Then redo questions 2 \& 3, but with the extensions on slide 26
and pp. 136--138.  Fully discuss the changes you've made.

Which method (more training vs. better features) gave better improvement
over your baseline?  Why do you think that is?

\end{flushleft}

\subsection{The Answer}

Training off 90 entries
\begin{center}
Precision = 0.6, Recall =  0.75

F-measure =0.666666666667
\end{center}


Using 50 entries and entryfeatures() vector
\begin{center}
Precision = 0.9, Recall =  0.957446808511

F-measure =0.927835051546
\end{center}
